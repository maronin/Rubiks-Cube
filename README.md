Features:
- Randomize cube
- Turn cube
- Change material properties of the cube (how reflective or metal it can be)

WIP:
- Adding some sort of UI or controls for turning the cube directions. Currently only the debug menu can be used, which is really clunky to use

Proof of concept - Arrows on each corner of each cube section that are invisible until they are hovered over with a mouse. Clicking the arrow will rotate the cube in the proper direction:
